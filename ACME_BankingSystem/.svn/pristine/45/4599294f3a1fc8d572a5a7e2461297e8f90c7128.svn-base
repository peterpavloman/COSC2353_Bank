DO WE HAVE TO CREATE A NEW PROJECT FOR THE HOMELOAN SYSTEM???

1. Customer login
	JPA Entity

2. Create a HomeLoan account (Amount borrowed entered during account creation)
	Business rules:
	- Can only be opened when there is a saving account
	- Must have 3 or more deposits in saving account (customers must prove they can make regular deposits)
		- Across ALL saving accounts (eg. acc1 has 2 deposits, acc2 has 1 deposit = valid)
	JPA Entity

3. Make a repayment to a HomeLoan account. Money must come from Savings account. Use JMS.
	- Must have transaction support

	Create HOMELOANTRANSACTION table
		id primary key
		BANKTRANSACTION.ID_BANKTRANSACTION foreign key
		ID_HOMELOANACCOUNT required
		
	JPA Entity for home loan operation
	JMS for saving operation (may need to modify ass1 to return transaction id whenever withdrawing / depositing)
		
4. List all customer accounts (Savings & HomeLoan). Get data from Sub-System 1 using JMS.
	
	Use JPA Entity for listing accounts
	JMS for the $ amount in Savings accounts
	JPA Entity for $ amount in HomeLoan accounts

5. Expose a rest web service that a third party system can use to retreive investor data. The web
service should return the total amount of money the bank has from all of its savings accounts..
This will need to use JMS to connect to Sub-System1.

	Use JPA Entity for listing accounts
	JMS for the $ amount in Savings accounts



JMS
	- When establishing JMS connection, HomeLoan application transmits Employee login/password for a 'service' account
	to the SavingsApplication's message bean.
	- Message bean will save Employee login/password details and use it for any operations with SavingApplication bean
